# Cluster Pandas Dataframe.

**Human:**
cluster a dataframe based on namelike on pandas

**Assistant:**

To cluster a dataframe based on name-like values in Pandas, you can use string matching techniques to identify similar names and group them together. Here's an example:

Suppose you have a dataframe called `df` that contains a column called "Name" that you want to cluster:

```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Name": ["John Smith", "John Smyth", "Jane Doe", "Janet Doe", "Mike Johnson"]
})

```

You can use the `str.contains()` method to create a boolean mask that identifies which rows contain a particular name-like pattern:

```
mask_john = df["Name"].str.contains("John")
mask_jane = df["Name"].str.contains("Jane")
mask_janet = df["Name"].str.contains("Janet")
mask_mike = df["Name"].str.contains("Mike")

```

Then you can use these masks to group the dataframe by name-like patterns:

```
john_group = df[mask_john]
jane_group = df[mask_jane]
janet_group = df[mask_janet]
mike_group = df[mask_mike]

```

This will give you four dataframes, one for each name-like pattern. You can also use the `groupby()` method to group the original dataframe by name-like patterns:

```
groups = df.groupby(df["Name"].str.replace("[^a-zA-Z]", ""))

```

This will group the dataframe by the "Name" column after removing all non-letter characters from each name. The resulting `groups` object is a `DataFrameGroupBy` object that you can iterate over to access each group:

```
for name, group in groups:
    print(name)
    print(group)

```

This will print the name-like pattern and the corresponding dataframe for each group.
